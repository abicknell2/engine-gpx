Ecovative goes right from the mixer into bags.\n- let the number of racks be optimized\n- oven cure is like only an hour. Takes the time to load and unload the racks\n- buoys per mold\n- molds per rack\n- 8 hr shifts with extension on the initial cure\n- updated fill molds operation to reflect bulk filler\n## 2022.09.18\n- [X] biomass reactor sizing based off of harvest fraction\n- reactor capacity tied to size\n- daily output of biomass as the production rate driver\n- biomass costs\n- added some labor costs just to get an idea\n- * floor space requirements\n  - * add uncertainty to the floor space\n- solving at 1t/day and 2.5t/day show a nice decrease in costs from lifting off of minimum workstation count constraints\n## 2022.09.26\n- add ramp time to oven process time\n  - 1 F / min\n  - going to 200 F\n## 2022.10.15\n- bag-based process for \n- calculate bags per day\n- add bags as a recurring cost (based on bags per day)\n\n\n# Questions\n## 2022-09-01\n- [x] what time is needed in the reactor (current assumption is 3 days)\n  - no reactor step\n- [x] what does this initial reactor look like?\n  - the reactor can just feed the filling line?\n  - ecovative seems to put it in a big ribbon mixer to inoculate and add water. then they put it in bins\n  - 35 cu Ft ribbon mixer is roughly $20k\n- [ ] T4 or T4 plus?
